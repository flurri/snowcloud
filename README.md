snowcloud
=========

snowcloud is intended to be a CloudApp client for BSD and Linux
systems. It uses the Xlib library for its frontend, and will be using
cURL and Jansson for the libcloudapp backend. Currently, libcloudapp
is planned to be included in the snowcloud repository, but is planned
to be usable as a standalone library.
