snowcloud
=========

snowcloud is intended to be a CloudApp client for BSD and Linux
systems. It uses the Xlib and cairo libraries for its frontend
(composition manager required), and will be using cURL and Jansson for
the libcloudapp backend. Currently, libcloudapp is planned to be
included in the snowcloud repository, but is planned to be usable as a
standalone library.
